# Excel-Attendance-Automation
During my internship at The Sukhjit Agro Industries., I designed and automated an Attendance Management Sheet using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to simplify daily attendance tracking, minimize manual errors, and make monthly attendance summaries more efficient. The sheet included employee-wise records with pre-built formulas to calculate present days, leaves, absences, and holidays automatically.
I used functions like IF, COUNTIF and conditional formatting to automate status marking (P, A, L, H), and built monthly totals without the need for repetitive manual counting. The sheet also flagged missing entries and inconsistencies, ensuring better accuracy and compliance. This automation saved significant time for the HR team, especially during payroll processing.
